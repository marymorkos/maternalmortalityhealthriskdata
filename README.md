# Maternal Health Risk Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for maternal health risk classification. The model aims to predict the risk level of complications during pregnancy and childbirth using various features such as medical history, demographic information, and clinical measurements. By accurately classifying pregnant women into different risk categories, healthcare providers can tailor interventions and resources to meet the specific needs of high-risk patients, ultimately improving maternal and neonatal outcomes.

## Key Features

- Utilizes machine learning techniques for risk classification in maternal health.
- Incorporates a diverse range of features, including medical history and clinical measurements.
- Aims to improve risk management strategies and enhance maternal health outcomes.
